Task 1: Load and Explore:
The dataset includes 1,000 sales records with columns such as order_id, order_date, and total_price (task1_head.png). For example, an Electronics order on 2024-04-12 had a total price of $126.98.

Data types are appropriate: order_date is datetime, unit_price and total_price are floats (task1_info.png).

Initially, 10 unit_price and 5 region values were missing (task1_missing_before.png). These were filled with the mean ($104.77) and mode, respectively, leaving no missing values (task1_missing_after.png).

Task 2: Basic Analysis:
The average total_price is $533.18, with a maximum of $1,799.46, indicating some high-value sales (task2_stats.png).

Electronics has the highest average sale at $564.20, while Clothing is lowest at $503.38 (task2_groups.png).

Average quantities are stable (~4.9â€“5.2 units), suggesting unit_price variations drive differences in total_price.

Task 3: Visualizations:
The line chart (plot1_line_screenshot.png) shows monthly sales trends for 2024, likely with fluctuations due to random date distribution.

The bar chart (plot2_bar_screenshot.png) highlights Electronics as the top category, confirming the group means.

The histogram (plot3_histogram_screenshot.png) indicates most sales are below $500, with a right skew due to larger orders.

The scatter plot (plot4_scatter_screenshot.png) shows no strong correlation between unit_price and quantity, with categories mixed.
